                    overall
                    well-being. For example, technology has enabled healthcare institutions to become more efficent,
                    while
                    telemedicine apps have made healthcare more equal and accessible to all, regardless of socioeconomic
                    situation. Similarly, technology has made educatiion more accessible and scalable than ever before,
                    with
                    several learning platforms aggregating courses for different age groups, as well as from other areas
                    and
                    sectors. <br><br> On the other hand, technology has had certain detrimental effects on society.
                    Social
                    media, in particular, has been condemned for spreading disinformation, hate speech, and harassment,
                    as
                    well as for isolating and depressing people. It's vital to remember that technology has the
                    potential to
                    make our lives both easier and more difficult. It all relies on how we use it. </p>
